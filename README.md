# TRS-80.M3.Assembler
Various Old Model III assembler utilities/programs I wrote.  
All were assembled with the Model III Series 1 Editor/Assembler (Disk version)
Most are probably more useful as examples.  
    Unless otherwise noted all were meant to run under TRSDOS.  Many will run under LDOS with no modification.
    Some I've converted to run under LDOS and/or LSDOS (Model IV).
Have Fun
